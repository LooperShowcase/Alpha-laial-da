    <h2>BMW HISTORY</h2>
    <p>
      BMW was created in 1917 from the Munich firm Rapp-Motorenwerke. The
      company was incorporated into Knorr-Bremse AG in 1920 before being
      refounded as BMW AG in 1922. It was the successor of Bayerische
      Flugzeugwerke AG, founded in 1916. 1916 is therefore considered BMW's
      founding year.
    </p>

    <h2>how BMW started</h2>
    <p>
      The company was established in Munich, Germany in 1916 by Franz Josef
      Popp, Karl Rapp, and Camillo Castiglioni. BMW began by producing airplane
      engines but then shifted its focus after World War I to motorcycle
      production and later diversified into car production.

    <h2>Why BMW cars are so special?</h2>
    <p>
      BMWs are known for their excellent build quality. Many other brands tend
      to cut corners on things like paintwork, interior materials, and dashboard
      design in order to save money. BMWs don't do this – and won't ever do this
      – they make sure everything has a premium look and feel, inside and out.
